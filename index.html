        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002.</p></div>

              – when featuring an example available through an Essex motorcycle retailer – that 24 examples 
              were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having adjustable steering head angle, Kawasaki 
              GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani front forks and Marvic wheels. The bodywork was 
              plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank and seat cover ending 
              in a rear tail-fairing. The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini stylists and produced by
